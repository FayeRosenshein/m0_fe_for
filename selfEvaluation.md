# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
  * I am not as confident as I thought before going in but I am more confident now that I have looked at my notes and done the exercises
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  * I felt overwhelmed at first but after doing the exercises for a while I became more confident about my understanding of the lessons
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * I still need to practice everything I have learned so far. It is not easy to memorize so I just need to continue practicing to get it right
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * I don't have any questions but if I do I can ask my classmates for help
